# Welcome to MediaChain!

**MediaChain** is a new way to manage copyright for any type of media: with our service, artists can receive receive loyalties quicker and more transparently, while enterprises can pay directly to a smart contract, without having to reach an institution.

## What technologies do we use?

- Blockchain-based approach, with our own appchain built with [Tanssi](https://www.tanssi.network/testnet-campaign);
- Account abstraction for users, implemented with [Lumx Protocol](https://docs.lumx.io/get-started/introduction);


In our platform, users can send their art, whether it be a song (audio) or video, and it will be turn into an NFT1155 representing the ownership of the copyright, without having to create a Metamask. This NFT can have multiple owners, each one having their respective percentage on the royalty payment of that work (e.g.: composer (40%), vocalist (30%), guitarist (30%)).
